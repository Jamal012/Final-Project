     <p>Despite the internet being an invaluable source, it also in some cases is bad for us. With the internet, many believe that
     their relationships with others weaken. People use the internet for leisure as well. The WWW can give people unhealthy addictions to staring at screens. The internet is full of entertaining and addicting websites so people use it for different things
     that they like which can addict them. "Teens can develop addiction due to various reasons like trying to escape loneliness and depression, social anxiety, and intense desire to search for knowledge."
     Another report said that kids who spend most of their time in a virtual world are easily moved away from the real world. Also one of
     the biggest things why the WWW is bad is because it causes <i>sleep deprivation.</i></p>

   in school. It helps increase knowledge of students. Many people nowadays are taking online classes. Currently 48 states support online learning.
     It's also helped increase summer school programs. It opens doors to infinite information and gives students "extra resources, study materials, and educational games."
