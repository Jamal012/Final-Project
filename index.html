 <h1>Tim Berners-Lee</h1>
   <hr>
 <p>Tim Berners-Lee is best known for inventing the world wide web. He has helped the world in an amazing way with his great achievements.
    He invented HTML, the world wide web, the web browser, and HyperText Transfer Protocol. His invention of the World Wide Web has
     helped the world in many ways.

 <p> The internet has helped people's lives. It has made it easier to live. It is the best source for learning new stuff quickly.
  The internet is rich in knowledge and helps children prepare for the future and learn about many important factors in life to succeed.
With the internet available to students and teachers, "we can speed up the economic growth and enhance the well-being of society throughout the world."
 The network will keep giving endless information which makes it an "inexhaustible source of information."   
 <p>Despite the internet being an invaluable source, it also in some cases is bad for us. With the internet, many believe that
     their relationships with others weaken. There are also fun stuff people use the internet for like games, sports, movies, etc.
     The WWW can give people unhealthy addictions to staring at screens. The internet is full of stuff so people use it for different things
     that they like which can addict them. "Teens can develop addiction due to various reasons like trying to escape loneliness and depression, social anxiety, and intense desire to search for knowledge."
     Another report said that kids who spend most of their time in a virtual world are easily moved away from the real world. One of
     the biggest things why the WWW is bad is because it causes <article> <h1>sleep deprivation.</h1> </article>
 <p> The internet has impacted education in a really positive way. The internet has helped schools reduce costs of many materials.
   The internet has helped students take advantage of the internet outside of school times to learn new stuff that are not taught 
   in school. It helps increase knowledge of students. It has reportedly helped teachers and parents to reduce costs and enhance school quality. 
 Many people nowadays are taking online classes. Currently 48 states support online learning.
     It's also helped increase summer school programs. It opens doors to infinite information and gives students "extra resources, study materials, and educational games."</p>
